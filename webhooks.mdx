## Webhook Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your documentation projects. This enables integration with other tools and automation workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook" icon="link">
    Navigate to project settings and add a new webhook endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events" icon="bell">
    Choose which events you want to receive notifications for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Security" icon="shield">
    Set up webhook signatures to verify incoming requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Integration" icon="check-circle">
    Send a test event to verify your endpoint is working correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Events

You can subscribe to various events in your documentation projects:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Document Events" icon="file-text">
    Notifications for document creation, updates, and deletions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Project Events" icon="folder">
    Alerts for project changes and team member updates.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Events" icon="users">
    Notifications about user account changes and permissions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="info">Webhook payloads include detailed information about the event that triggered them.</Callout>

## Payload Structure

All webhook payloads follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "document.updated",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "project": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "My Project"
  },
  "data": {
    "document_id": "456",
    "changes": {
      "title": "Updated Title",
      "content": "New content here..."
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

Secure your webhook endpoints to prevent unauthorized access:

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Verify Signatures" default-open="true">
    Use HMAC signatures to verify that webhook requests come from Alexandra Janney Documentation.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Use HTTPS" default-open="false">
    Always use HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints to encrypt data in transit.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Validate Payloads" default-open="false">
    Check that incoming payloads match expected schemas before processing.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Common webhook issues and their solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Webhook not firing | Check that the event type is selected in webhook settings |
| Signature verification fails | Ensure you're using the correct secret key |
| Payload parsing errors | Validate the JSON structure of incoming requests |
